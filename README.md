## Project Description
Given data files describing COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries around the globe,  
our goal is to ask and answer pertinent questions that will result in useful conclusions  
that the WHO may use to guide its decision making.

## Technologies Used

* Ubuntu - 18.04
* WSL2
* YARN
* Apache Hadoop - 3.3.0
* Apache Hive - 2.3.8
* Apache Spark 3.1.1

## Questions/Metrics we will calculate from the dataset

* Numbers of confirmed cases and deaths by country
  * Can tell which countries were impacted the most and where to direct aid
* Confirmed cases growth rate by U.S. State
  * Analyzes how different state policies may have affected the spead of COVID-19
* Ratios between confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries by country
  * Can lead to understandings of the effectiveness of the treatments enacted by different countries
